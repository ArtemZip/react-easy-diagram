## Installation
Using `npm`:

## Getting started
There are three main entities in library: `node`, `port`, `link`.

To create simple diagram import `Diagram`:
```
import { Diagram } from "react-easy-diagram";
```
Pass it to the rendering function and provide props, for example:
```
const YourDiagram = () => (
    <Diagram initState={{
        nodes: [
          {
            id: "node_1",
            position: [300, 300],
          },
          {
            id: "node_2",
            position: [520, 400],
          },
        ],
        links: [
          {
            source: {
              nodeId: "node_1",
              portId: "output"
            },
            target: {
              nodeId: "node_2",
              portId: "input"
            }
          },
        ]
      }} />
);
```
Right now you can use only examples to see how you can customize, change settings and do other things. 
Also, thanks to typescript you can explore API right in the code editor. 
Documentation is a top priority and will be provided as soon as possible.
